    Variables   | Type  | Description
    total          | int    | The total number of elements within the matrix

    print_iter     | int    | Placeholder, used to find the number of iterations which has been run

    start          | clock_t| The clock when we reach a certain part of the code
    end            | clock_t| The clock when we are finished with that part of the code

    gpus           | int    | Number of GPUs used when running the program
    device_nr      |*int    | An array which will allow the GPU to see which GPU number it has

    maxEps         |**double| Used by the GPU to calculate how many elements which exceed the allowed limit of change for an element between two iterations
    maxEps_print   |*double | Used as a destination for the number of elements which the GPU has calculated exceeding the limit

    rows_total     | int    | Is the total number of rows which will be computed on by the devices
    rows_per_device| int    | The number of rows per 
    rows_leftover  | int    | The number of GPUs which is required to have an additional row when rows_total cannot be split equally between the devices
    rows_device    | int    | Number of rows each gpus will recieve, including ghostrows
    rows_index     | int    | Contains the index of the row which will be the first row to be transferred to the designated GPU
    rows_compute   | int    | Will tell the GPU how many rows it will compute on

    threadSize     | int    | Total number of threads in work in a GPU
    threadInformatin| int   | Is used to give the GPU information of how many elements each thread has to compute on

    mat            |*double | The matrix which is to be used as base for computations
    mat_gpu        |**double| The matrix which will be a part of the mat matrix, will be the part which is given to one GPU
    mat_gpu_tmp    |**double| Is used so that the GPU can change between the two matrixes every iteration

    streams        |cudaStream_t| Contains the streams each GPU will use to allow for asynchronous computing

    kernelColl     |***void | Is a collection of all the functions each GPU will use to run the CUDA function on in a kernel

    filename       | char   | The name of the textdocument which will be created to compare resulting matrixes
    fptr           |*FILE   | Used to create the file
